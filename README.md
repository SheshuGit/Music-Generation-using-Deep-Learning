# Music Generation using Deep Learning

This project focuses on generating music based on the user's input emotions using Deep Learning techniques. The system first analyzes the sentiment of a given sentence, maps it to an emotion, and then generates music corresponding to that emotion using the MusicgenForConditionalGeneration model.

## Introduction

The Music Generation using Deep Learning project combines sentiment analysis and deep learning models to create music based on emotional input. It utilizes a pre-trained sentiment analysis model to classify emotions and a specialized music generation model (MusicgenForConditionalGeneration) to produce music tailored to each emotion.

## Setup

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SheshuGit/Music-Generation-using-Deep-Learning.git
   cd Music-Generation-using-Deep-Learning
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download model weights and data files:**
   - [Provide instructions or scripts if any additional setup is needed]

## Usage

1. **Input:**
   - Provide a sentence describing your current mood.

2. **Processing:**
   - The sentiment analysis model will classify the emotion associated with the input.

3. **Output:**
   - Based on the detected emotion, the MusicgenForConditionalGeneration model will generate music using predefined instruments and genres stored in `emotions_and_music.json`.

## Files

- **Music Generation.ipynb:** Jupyter notebook containing the main code for sentiment analysis and music generation.
- **README.md:** This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.
- **emotions_and_music.json:** JSON file mapping emotions to music instruments and genres.
- **test.csv, training.csv, validation.csv:** Additional data files used in training or evaluation.
